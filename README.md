# Classification-of-Astronomical-Objects
This project's goal is to classify sky objects such as star, galaxy, and quasar via sdss data. 
I couldn't push the data but you can reach it via sql command in the project folder. 
And, you can reach the details from my medium post: https://medium.com/@alpercakr
